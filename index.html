            <h2>Security Concerns in HTTP/2 Protocol</h2>
            <p> HTTP 2 is a major modification to HTTP protocol with its predecessor being standardized in 1997. HTTP 2
                (standardized in 2015) was developed from SPDY protocol, Google's experimental protocol, which proved to
                be extremely efficient compared to HTTP 1.1. This protocol has seen tremendous acceptance rate,
                according to W3Techs around 11% of top 10 Million websites already supported this protocol by December
                2016.</p>
            <p> Since this is a new protocol with very high acceptance rate, we at SEFCOM Lab at ASU thought to look at
                the protocol from security point of view.<BR>
                To properly look into this protocol we chose NGINX and Apache as web-servers and Chrome, Firefox and
                Safari as the client. The basic idea behind this choice was to cover most the of the web transaction and
                by using these we covered roughly around 80% of the traffic.</p>
            <h4>Results / Bugs (patched and notified)</h4>
            <p> We discovered a very serious Denial of Service bug in the Apache web-server. Apache HTTPD web server
                versions 2.4.17 through 2.4.23 did not apply limitations on request headers correctly when experimental
                module for the HTTP/2 protocol is used to access a resource. The net result is that a server allocates
                too much memory instead of denying the request. This can lead to memory exhaustion and hence Denial of
                Service attack on the server by a properly crafted request.
                Attack script for the same can be found <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40909/">here</a>
                and all the patch related code and details can be found
                <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-8740">here</a>.</p>

            <h2>Heart disease prediction based on ECG data.</h2>
            <p> Electrocardiography (ECG or EKG from the Dutch Electrokardiogram) is a transthoracic (across the thorax
                or chest) interpretation of the electrical activity of the heart over a period of time, as detected by
                electrodes attached to the outer surface of the skin and recorded by a device external to the body. The
                recording produced by this noninvasive procedure is termed as electrocardiogram (also ECG or EKG). An
                electrocardiogram (ECG) is a test that records the electrical activity of the heart.</p>
            <h4>Approach / Methodology used or analysed.</h4>
            <p>The Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) has been widely used in ECG signal analysis since this type of
                signals (short high-frequency impulses (R wave) superimposed on slowly varying waveforms (P, T, U waves)
                , including artifacts and noise) favors processing tools with variable time-frequency resolution.
                Reported results indicate that DWT not only enables reliable identification of specific points and
                segments characterizing the ECG waveforms, but may also yield high compression ratios since most of the
                signal energy is concentrated in a limited number of significant coefficients.</p>
            <p>The computation model called the artificial neural network (ANN) is use to enhance the performance of
                electrocardiography signal detection and classification that provides a parallel, distributed, nonlinear
                computing network that mimics the information processing structure of a biologic neural network. This
                approach tries to mimic the way doctors manually analyze the Electro Cardiogram signal.</p>
            <p>The use of statistical method for the analysis of an Electro Cardiogram signal has been in use for a long
                time. This method takes into account the variation in the values of different peaks and statistically
                analyzes it to derive relation between them for every disease. Result obtained from this method is poor
                due to the effect of noise in the electro cardiogram signal.</p>

            <h2>OCR for Tibetan Script</h2>
            <p> Optical Character Recognition for Tibetan Script has been developed as a part of Technology Development
                in Indian Languages (TDIL) project in accordance with the requirements and specifications of Ministry of
                Communication and Information Technology, India funded by Ministry of Human Resources, India.</p>
            <p> The project aims to develop software that converts scanned images of Tibetan books into their
                corresponding document files in the most efficient and error-free manner. We were able to achieve an
                accuracy of around 89%.</p>
            <h4>Approach / Methodology used or analysed.</h4>
            <p> Pre-processing: This module is designated for enhancing the quality of the image for processing of the
                image in further modules of the system. The pre-processing module further involves several other sub
                modules like Noise Removal, Binarization, Skew correction etc.</p>
            <p> Segmentation: The objective of the segmentation module is to extract each character from the text present
                in the image document</p>
            <p> Feature Extraction: We analysed Principal component analysis and Gabor filter to extract the feature
                from the image. Final we used Gabor filter due to its high accuracy with Support Vector Machine as
                classifier.</p>
            <p> Classifier: We experiment with a lot of classifier and eventually settled on Support Vector Machine.</p>
            <p> Dictionary: We used N-gram Model to improve the accuracy of the classification. Since Tibetan script is
                based on Sanskrit so tibetan script cannot have dictionary.</p>
